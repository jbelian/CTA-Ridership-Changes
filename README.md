# [Trends in ridership on the CTA ðŸšŒðŸš…](https://jbelian.github.io/cta-trends/)

Hi there. I drew inspiration for this from my Computer Science capstone, Bus Ridership Forecasting. I created a user friendly map that visualizes month-to-month changes in ridership with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). The most notable period is from Feb 2020 to Apr 2020, which saw huge decreases in ridership at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, up to a -98.6% decrease for one bus line in particular.

Currently, this is a work in progress, with updates coming soon:
- Add a toggle to swap the display between bus routes and train routes [(the "L")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22)
- Add a legend for change in ridership, from blue (positive) to red (negative)
- More informative tooltips
