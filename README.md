# [CTA Ridership Changes ðŸšŒðŸš…](https://jbelian.github.io/cta-ridership-changes/)

_Dec 26, 2023_

I drew inspiration for this from my previous project, [Bus Ridership Forecasting](https://github.com/jbelian/WGU-Capstone-Bus-Ridership-Forecasting). This is a user friendly map that visualizes month-to-month changes in ridership with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). The most notable period is from Feb 2020 to Apr 2020, which saw huge decreases in ridership at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, up to a -98.6% decrease for one bus line in particular.

Updates coming soon:
- Add a toggle to swap the display between bus routes and train routes [(the "L")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22)
- Add a legend for change in ridership, from blue (positive) to red (negative)
- More informative tooltips
