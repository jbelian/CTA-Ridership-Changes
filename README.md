# [CTA Ridership Changes ðŸšŒðŸš…](https://jbelian.github.io/cta-ridership-changes/)

I drew inspiration for this from my previous project, [Bus Ridership Forecasting](https://github.com/jbelian/WGU-Capstone-Bus-Ridership-Forecasting). This is an interactive map that visualizes month-to-month changes in ridership on the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority). The most notable period is from Feb 2020 to Apr 2020, which saw huge decreases in ridership at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, up to a -98.6% decrease for one bus line in particular. A daily API call checks for new ridership data, and the app is updated if any is found.

Updates coming soon:
- Add a toggle to swap the display between bus routes and train routes [(the "L")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22)
- ~~Add a legend for change in ridership, from blue (positive) to red (negative)~~ âœ…
- ~~More informative tooltips~~ âœ…
